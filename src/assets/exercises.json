                "Slow and steady wins the race on this exercise. Don’t just speed through these. Find a controlled, rhythmic pace to really feel this movement. 2 Seconds Down, 1 Second Pause, 2 Seconds Up. Repeat",
                "Keep your hands around chest height. Hands placed too high put more work on our elbows than we need at the moment. Hands placed too low make it difficult to keep our palms flat. A good “rule of thumb” is being able to maintain flat palms and feel a slight stretch in your wrist while your arms are straight.",
                 "Keep your body firm. Don’t arch your body at the bottom to make the motion easier. Core strength is important for all calisthenics, and this is a great place to start building it."
